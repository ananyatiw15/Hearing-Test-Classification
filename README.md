# Hearing-Test-Classification
With over 466 million sufferers globally, hearing loss is a serious public health issue. Numerous things, including as ageing, exposure to noise, 
and specific medical disorders, can contribute to it. A person's ability to communicate, interact with others, and take part in activities they like can all 
be significantly impacted by hearing loss.

To reduce the effects of hearing loss on a person's life, early detection and treatment are crucial. On the other hand, hearing tests might not 
always be accurate and might be costly and time-consuming. High accuracy models for classifying hearing tests can be created using machine learning. This may enhance the 
early identification and management of hearing loss.
